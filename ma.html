<h2 class = "g">Representing Mobile Company</h2>

<p><b>A mobile service provider is a company that sells wireless connectivity to customers for cellphone data and telephone calls. It may also be called a mobile network operator, a mobile carrier, cellular company or wireless service provider. </b></p>

<p class = "t">data and phone calls are not included free with a cellphone or smartphone. The wireless connectivity for 4G and 5G must be purchased from a mobile service provider. These are typically either a monthly subscription or a pay-as-you-go service.

Most smartphone hardware is compatible with several mobile service providers. Subsidized smartphones may be locked so that they can only be used with a specific provider though. The mobile service provider will use a SIM card or provision an eSIM to authenticate the device on the network and identify the user. </p>
